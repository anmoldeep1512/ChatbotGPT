# ChatBot-GPT

Welcome to the OpenAI Dialogue Bot initiative. This dialogue bot is developed using Python and OpenAI's model. It enables users to engage and resolve their inquiries in a conversational style. The user interface of the dialogue bot is constructed using the pqd6 library.

## Project Layout

The project is organized into two primary Python files:

1. `main.py`: This file holds the logic for the User Interface (UI) and the amalgamation of the backend with the frontend.

2. `backend.py`: This file holds the logic for invoking the OpenAI API and receiving the response.

Besides these, there is a requirements.txt file that enumerates all the Python dependencies that need to be installed for the project to function.

## Installation

To install the project, follow these instructions:

1. Download the repository to your local system.

2. Install the necessary dependencies by executing the following command in your terminal:
```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```    

3. Open the `backend.py` file and provide your OpenAI key. You can obtain this key from the OpenAI website after registration.

4. Execute the `main.py` file to launch the dialogue bot.

## Operation

Once you have installed the project, you can begin engaging with the dialogue bot. Simply input your inquiry into the text box and press enter. The dialogue bot will reply with an answer or a supplementary question.
